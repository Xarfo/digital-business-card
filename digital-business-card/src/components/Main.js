                    <div>I develop accessible, optimized and user-friendly web applications. I value problem solving, communication and collaboration as integral part of the creative process of software engineering. I like to be involved in the refinement processes, version control, code reviews, testing, building, deploying, hosting and monitoring the health of the application.

From a personal trait standpoint, I am quite adaptable, always open to change and learn. I try to be aware of blind spots and weaknesses that may exist and take steps to remedy them. I take extreme ownership of my work and character.</div>
